So that took a year (wow)... Ok, let's get started with the 80s theme.

## It starts with a challenge

I decided that the theme needs to be a bit of a challenge; it can only be styled using HTML, CSS, and JS, no images and no .svg files. Yet, and most importantly, this cannot affect the quality of the design.

I still have more work to do, but so far, we have a working header done entirely in CSS. All code is avail on my CodePen.

As always, have fun!
