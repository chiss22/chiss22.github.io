## Something new

Part of being a professor in the web design field means that you have to be prepared when the inevitable moment comes; a student ask you if you know about X. X of course being that latest and greatest movement in our industry: CSS Grid and Flex, the latest IDE, or animating gradients for a sampling.

Now of course as a prof we have all the time in the world to research and play with the latest, right? Unfortunately no. We find ourselves instead in a constant backlog of work, not to mention, as a part-time prof, I still have my [day job](https://www.getsproutstudio.com/), meaning free-time to play is simply not a reality.

With that said (and frankly out of the way), let's get back to business. Even without extra play time, we still must find a way, so, welcome to my personal site project built with something pretty freakin' cool: GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

### GitHub Pages

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to build an entire flat file website from scratch, host on GitHub for _FREE_ (what?!), and even configure SASS to auto precompile.

Not to mention, it is _crazy_ fast, supports HTTPS, and lets you use your own domain. Nuts right?

_Disclaimer: I am working on a vid tutorial for this in the future, so stay tuned_

### Jekyll

Where things get even more badass is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ([Quick-start Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)). Jekyll is a static website generator powered by Markdown or Textile, Liquid, HTML, CSS, and JS.

With Jekyll you can easily create _includes_ for things like navigation, headers and footers, run a _blog_, and, using _Markdown_, quickly and easily write content!

### Where to go from here

Realizing that yes, this site right now is completely underwhelming looking (just literally started it), the next step is to make it better looking (planning a slick 80s graphics theme).

For now, stay trendy,

_Chris_
