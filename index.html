    <h2>Chris Bowman, nice to meet you!</h2>
    <p class="hero">I've been designing and developing on the web since 2004. I am a co-founder of <a href="https://getsproutstudio.com/">Sprout Studio</a> where I lead the design and development team. During the school year, I teach web dev at <a href="https://niagaracollege.ca/">Niagara College</a>, and on my spare time I do mini-design projects (logos, website, etc) for awesome people. <a href="mailto:chriswrbowman@gmail.com">Email me</a>. <a href="https://instagram.com/chrisbowman22">Follow me</a></p>
